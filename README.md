# Hi, I'm Chris

I'm a recent Electrical Engineering graduate from the University of Calgary with a deep passion for technology. I am keenly interested in front-end development, Embedded Systems, and AI/ML. 

I have worked on a handful of projects which include working on microcontroller systems using PIC and STM32-based devices and developing web applications like the BabelBot. I am always on the look out for new opportunities and projects to do and get my hands dirty as there is no better way to learn.

I am currently working on an X Clone Project (I still call it Twitter) and writing firmware for the CubeSat, basically a tiny satellite, as a software developer for CalgaryToSpace.

Feel free to check out my projects below! If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's connect!
