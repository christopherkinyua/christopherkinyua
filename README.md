# Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm a recent Electrical Engineering graduate from the University of Calgary with a deep passion for technology. I have a keen interest in front-end development, Embedded Systems, and AI/ML. 

I have worked on a handful of projects which include working on microcontroller systems using PIC and STM32-based devices and developing web applications like the BabelBot. I am always on the look out for new opportunities and projects to do and get my hands dirty as there is no better way to learn ðŸ˜„.

Outside of this, I am a Freelance Photographer and I love taking portrait photographs. This acts as a creative outlet and helps me tell my story and to interact with people. If I'm not taking photos, you will find me gaming. I'm a fan of competitive and RPG games, you might find me in the Land of Between (IYKYK). 

I am currently working on a Twitter Clone Project and writing firmware for the CubeSat, basically a tiny satellite, as a software developer for CalgaryToSpace.

Feel free to check out my projects below! If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out. I don't bite haha! My socials are linked below
